            Hi! I'm Leonardo, a web developer who also makes games in his spare time.
            Maybe someday I'll make them full-time!
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently I'm located in Florian√≥polis, Santa Catarina, Brazil, which is a
            naturally beautiful island city.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you need to talk to me, I'm available at a variety of services.
            Don't expect an immediate response in instant messagers!
        </p>
        <ContactsTable />
    </Layout>
